1. Verify that the loop in the delay() function actually takes 3 machine
   instructions. Use the KDS debugger for this or look at the assembly 
   listing generated by the build.
   - What are the assembly instructions corresponding to this loop?
   - What is the number of clock cycles for each of these instructions?

2. What happens if you remove the 'register' qualifier form the 'n' variable?

3. What is the size of the binary image copied to the flash
   of the KL25Z?

   What is the biggest image size that can fit in the flash
   of the KL25Z?

4. How much SRAM is consuming the data section of the lab1-blinking-led
   program? (hint look at the lab1-blinking-led.map file) 

5. Propose a way to detect an overflow when calculatinfg the value of
  of 'n' in the delay function.
  - Write a C expression to detect the overflow
  - What do you think the code needs to do if an overflow is detected
    and why?

3.  Modify main() of lab1-blinking-led to use different LED, then rebuild, flash
    and run the program, to verify that the image you built is actually running on the
    board. 

4. Modify main to make the LED blink, signaling the string "Hello World" in
   code. 

5. Add more logic to main() to do step 4 in an infinite loop that cycles
   through all the 7 different colors that the RGB LED can emit:
   (Hint:
          - red is ...
COLOR_RED       LED_RED_PIN_MASK 
67 #define LED_COLOR_GREEN     LED_GREEN_PIN_MASK 
68 #define LED_COLOR_YELLOW    (LED_RED_PIN_MASK | LED_GREEN_PIN_MASK) 
69 #define LED_COLOR_BLUE      LED_BLUE_PIN_MASK 
70 #define LED_COLOR_MAGENTA   (LED_RED_PIN_MASK | LED_BLUE_PIN_MASK) 
71 #define LED_COLOR_CYAN      (LED_GREEN_PIN_MASK | LED_BLUE_PIN_MASK) 
72 #define LED_COLOR_WHITE 
  
   )

Deliverables:
- Git patch with the code changes (generate the patch by committing your
  changes and then dooing 'git format-patch -1')
- lab1-blinking-led.bin generated by the build (test that it can be flashed on
  the KL25Z by copying the file to the MBED driver on your PC)
